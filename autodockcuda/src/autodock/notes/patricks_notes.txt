#fyi Real is #DEFINE and can either be set to float or double

array representation of atom (all floats):

#i dont know all of these variables are used we should figure that out eventually and cut some if we can
#there may be additional variables we need to include that i mistakenly thought were irrelevent

x,y,z, x',y',z', torsions

total size = (6 + max_torsions) * 3 * sizeof(Real)



array representation of individual:

#same goes as for the atom

x,y,z (of center)  w,x,y,z (quat)    torsion angles

total size = (7 + max_torsions) * sizeof(Real) + max_atoms * sizeof(atom)



total global memory buffer size:

population_size * ((7 + max_torsions) * sizeof(Real) + max_atoms * ((6 + max_torsions) * 3 * sizeof(Real)))
